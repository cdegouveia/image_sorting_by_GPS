Pyicloud might not work for you. A few weeks ago Apple changed features that only an updated module will be able to compensate for this change. 
In the meantime please donload base.txt. from this discussion https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud/issues/456 . 
Rename the file to base.py and replace the version installed in your module's folder with this new file. This should fix the issue.
